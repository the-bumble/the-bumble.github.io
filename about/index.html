  My name is Jake Miller and I am a security researcher working at Bishop Fox.
  In this role, I focus on discovering and improving attack techniques for web
  applications, developing offensive security tools, and
  reporting vulnerabilties uncovered along the way.

  This website is to track recent publications, projects, and share some
  of my learning experiences (blog coming soon).

  If you have any questions about my research, feel free to DM me on Twitter :)
